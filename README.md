# VirtualCoffeeMachine

You are to create a virtual coffee machine. The machine will accept 1,2,5,10,20,50 cent, 1 and 2 dollar coins. However, 1 and 2 cent coins are to be rejected.

With the total amount of coins inputted equal or greater, the user has the choice of three different coffees - each type having a different cost. 


	
$3.50 Cappuccino 
	
$3.00 Latte 
	
$4.00 Decaf 
	


The machine is to dispense the correct coffee and change (if change is required, itâ€™s to be broken up into coinage). 

This application can be developed in any language as long as it can be run (if complete).
